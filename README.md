# A Tale of Rust and the OBS

### Getting the Rust programming language into openSUSE

This talk will be a short introduction to the Rust programming
language, why it is useful and why you would want to use it. Then I
will discuss the current state of Rust in openSUSE, what the situation
is regarding packaging crates and what remains to be done.
